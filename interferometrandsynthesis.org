From the figure above we can guess how the uv plane is used. uv-plane
is defined in a plane normal to the direction of the phase reference
position. The spacing direction v is measured toward the north as
defined by the plane through the origin, the source, and the pole, and
u toward the east. The component w is measured in the direction s_0,
which is the phase reference position. The source I(l,m) l and m are
direction cosines measured with respect to the axes u and v. The
figure shown below will illustrate the geometry relationship.

interferometer. The antenna baseline vector, measured in wavelength,
has length D_\lambda and components (u,v,w).

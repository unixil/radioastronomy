From the figure above we can guess how the uv plane is used. uv-plane
is defined in a plane normal to the direction of the phase reference
position. The spacing direction v is measured toward the north as
defined by the plane through the origin, the source, and the pole, and
u toward the east. The component w is measured in the direction s_0,
which is the phase reference position. The source I(l,m) l and m are
direction cosines measured with respect to the axes u and v. The
figure shown below will illustrate the geometry relationship.

interferometer. The antenna baseline vector, measured in wavelength,
has length D_\lambda and components (u,v,w).

lm-plane is useful as illustrated in the following figure, the lm
plane is a plane tangent to the celestial sphere at point s_0, and the
fourier transformation is to transform between lm-plane and uv-plane.

l^{\prime}m^{\prime}-plane and u^{\prime}v^{\prime}-plane is
illustrated in the following figure, the l^{\prime}m^{\prime}-plane is
tangent to the celestial sphere at the pole and
u^{\prime}v^{\prime}-plane is parallel to the earth equation plane and
the direct fourie transformation is between the
l^{\prime}m^{\prime}-plane and u^{\prime}v^{\prime}-plane

The l^{\prime}m^{\prime}-plane can be projected onto the lm-plane, you
can check the information in P96 equation 3.15 and 3.16.
